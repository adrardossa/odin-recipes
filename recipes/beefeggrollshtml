    <p>Crispy fried egg rolls stuffed with ground beef, cabbage, and delicious seasonings. A personal creation of mine that goes well with any Chinese dish. The sherry makes it better.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>
        ½ teaspoon dried minced garlic</li>
        <li>
        2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>
        ½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>
        ½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>
        2 tablespoons sherry</li>
        <li>
        1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>
        1 large head cabbage, finely shredded</li>
        <li>
        ¼ cup water</li>
        <li>
        1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>
        1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>
        2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sherry</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for deep frying</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package egg roll wrappers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown beef, then mix in onion, garlic, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, 2 tablespoons sherry, and ginger. Continue to saute just until onions are tender. Transfer mixture to a bowl and set aside. </li>
    
        <li>In the same skillet, saute cabbage with water, 1 tablespoon oil, sugar, and remaining soy sauce, sherry, salt, and pepper. Continue to saute until cabbage is crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Return meat mixture to pan and stir together with cabbage over low heat until heated through. Remove from heat. </li>
    
        <li>Pour oil into a deep pan and heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fill each egg roll wrapper with approximately 1/4 cup of filling and roll up according to package directions. Fry in preheated oil until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve hot. </li>
